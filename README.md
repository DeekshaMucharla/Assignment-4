link.
Ans. Three websites that does not implement Responsive Web Design.
A vital component of contemporary web development, responsive web design makes sure 
that websites appear effectively across a variety of devices and screen sizes. Responsive 
Web Design is still not widely used on some websites, though. Three similar websites are 
shown here:

1. Craigslist ( https://kerala.craigslist.org/ ): A well-known online marketplace that 
links buyers and sellers of different goods and services is called Craigslist. 
Although being widely used, the website does not use responsive web design, 
making it difficult to adjust to various screen sizes. On mobile devices, this may 
make navigation challenging.

2. Drudge Report ( https://www.drudgereport.com/ ): A conservative news 
aggregator called Drudge Report offers connections to numerous news stories 
and websites. The website features a straightforward, text-based layout that is 
neither mobile- or screen-optimized.

3. Space Jam ( http://www.spacejam.com ): A website called Space Jam promotes 
the same-named movie from 1996. Since its initial introduction, the website has 
not been changed, and it continues to employ a fixed-width, non-responsive 
design. As a result, mobile devices or smaller displays struggle to show the 
website properly
